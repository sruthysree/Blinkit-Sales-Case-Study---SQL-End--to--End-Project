# Blinkit-Sales-Case-Study---SQL-End--to--End-Project
This project demonstrates an end-to-end SQL case study using Blinkit sales data. It covers data cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and reporting to extract meaningful business insights. The SQL scripts showcase how raw transactional data can be converted into actionable metrics for decision-making.
Objectives

Data Cleaning: Standardize inconsistent values (e.g., Item_Fat_Content).

Exploratory Analysis: Count items, check distinct categories, and compute KPIs.

Aggregations: Analyze sales by product type, outlet size, location, and establishment year.

Pivoting & Grouping: Compare sales across categories and regions.

Business Insights: Identify top-selling items, average ratings, and percentage contributions.
